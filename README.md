***This fork includes some minor changes to tinyBERT enabling the teacher model to load from a pretrained SentenceBert found at https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers, also the input pipeline was changed to facilitate the general distillation of a sentence embedding model*** 

Done as part of my thesis.
